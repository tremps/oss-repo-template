### 2 & 3
Without a license you can't guarantee that your project can be used as intended. If it is an open source project then a license guarantees the 4 criteria for free software and protects your code from being stolen (someone claims it is theirs and puts a closed license on it). If your prject is closed source then a license keeps it that way and prevents illegal use and distribution of your project.<br />

If a project doesn't have a license you shouldn't use it in order to protect yourself. The project could be stolen and you don't actually have permission to use it, or someone could later put a license on it that restricts your use without you knowing.<br />

I do agree with the claim. Open source was the better development option and is a large reason the web beat gopher. The open source development of the web gave it a large user base for frequent testing and feedback which resulted in better and more user frendly features. It also guaranteed free acess for everyone to the web.<br />

Android uses the Apache 2.0 license. This license is very permissive allowing developers to freely modify and develope new features. This is a strong selling point for Android and helps them compete with Apple so this license was a good choice for them [source](https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2007/11/why-google-chose-the-apache-software-license-over-gplv2/).<br />
